# Functors

## Recap (?)
Something something something

## Notes
```Haskell
class Functor t where
    fmap :: (a -> b) -> t a -> t b

instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just x) = Just (f x)
    fmap f  Nothing = Nothing

instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map

instance Functor Tree where
    | ...

fmap id = id
fmap f . fmap g = fmap (f . g)
```

### IO a
- Type of i/o that results in a value of type *a*.
- `getLine :: IO String`
- `read READ a => String -> a`   --> **read "123" :: Int** gives **123 :: Int**
- Reading int from string:
```Haskell
foo :: String -> Int
foo s = read s + 1
```
- `getIntLine :: IO Int`
- `foo = fmap read` is of type *t string -> t a* given (Read a, Functor t) =>
- `getIntLine = fmap read getLine`
> [!NOTE]
> What `getLine` reads from or its type are irrelevant to getting `getIntLine`. It returns `IO a`, and `a` is defined by the function definition of `read`.

- About `data` and `newtype`:
```Haskell
data Person    = Person String
newtype Person = Person String
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> On an execution level, both of these are same. `newtype` uses single constructor, and does not have an intermediate state. `data` can use multiple constructors and works based off lazy evaluation, where a type that's not yet evaluated can still be defined.

**Question**: Do `getPerson :: IO Person`.  
```Haskell
getLine :: IO String
newtype Person = Person String
read READ Person => String -> Person
getPerson = fmap read getLine  -- correct?
```
