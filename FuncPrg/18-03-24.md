## Pre class Things
With regard for:   
```Haskell
-- First function
foo = getLine   -- foo :: IO String()
main = do x <- getLine
          y <- getLine
          putStr (x ++ y)
```
- Both functions not executed as a consequence of Haskell being the other thing. When compiled, `main` is executed. 
- **`foo` is not executed, and can be ignored.**  
---
```Haskell
foo = getLine
main = do x <- getLine
          y <- foo
          putStr (x ++ y)
``` 
- `foo` is set to be executed before `main` to obtain its result and use it when `main` is executed finallly.
- **Order of execution: `foo` -> `main`**
---
```Haskell
foo = getLine
main = do x <- foo
          y <- foo
          putStr (x ++ y)
```
- `foo` is set to be executed twice to get `x` and `y`, which is to be used to `main`.
- **Order of execution: `foo` -> `foo` -> `main`**

## Not anymore tho

```Haskell
-- foo :: IO String
foo = do return "Hello"
            return "World"
main = do x <- foo
            putStrLn x
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `foo` is a function that uses the do notation to sequence two actions: `return "Hello"` and `return "World"`. In Haskell, `return` is a function that takes a value and wraps it in a monadic context. In this case, it's wrapping the strings "Hello" and "World" in the IO monad. However, because `foo` doesn't bind its results to anything, only the result of the last action (`return "World"`) is kept.
>
> `main` is the entry point of the program. It also uses the do notation to sequence two actions. The first action is `x <- foo`, which executes `foo` and binds its result to `x`. Remember that `foo` returns "World", so "World" is what gets bound to `x`. The second action is `putStrLn x`, which prints the value of `x` followed by a newline. So, when you run this program, it will print "World" to the console.

- `(++) <$> getLine <*> getLine`
- `(++)` is a pure function while the rest are IO functions.

## Interesting Monads:
- This one is not an IO
```Haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
    -- (>>=) :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
    (>>=) Nothing _ = Nothing
    (>>=) (Just x) f = f x 
```
