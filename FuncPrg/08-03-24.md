# Class Notes
```Haskell
class Functor t => Applicative t where
        pure  :: a -> t a
        (<*>) :: t (a -> b) -> t a -> t b

instance Applicative Maybe where 
    -- pure  : a -> Maybe a
       pure  : Just
    -- (<*>) : Maybe (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
       (<*>) (Just f) (Just a) = Just $ f a
       (<*>)    _        _     = Nothing
```

## Handling as *expressions*
```Haskell
data Exp = C Int
        |  PLUS Exp Exp
        |  DIV  Exp Exp
        |  MINUS Exp Exp
        |  MUL  Exp Exp
eval :: Exp -> Maybe Int
eval (C x) = Just x
eval (DIV e1 e2) = ---
```

Operation on expression goes like:
```Haskell
eval (Plus e1 e2) = case eval e1 of
                        Just x -> case eval e2 of
                                    Just y -> Just x + y
                                    Nothing -> Nothing
                        Nothing -> Nothing
```
> [!WARNING]
> Horrendous code due to having to *case* out every single operation on the expression.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> If there was no *Maybe*, the above code could be written as:  
> `eval (Plus e1 e2) = eval e1 + eval e2  
  
### Different (better?) approach
```Haskell
f : a -> b -> c -> d   
ma : Maybe a
mb : Maybe b
mc : Maybe c
```
> It is like: `f <$> ma <*> mb <*> mc`  
> `f <$> ma = pure f <*> ma`  
  
Since `eval e1 + eval e2` can be written as `(+) (eval e1) (eval e2)`, the earlier expression of `eval (Plus e1 e2)` can be written as: `(+) <$> eval e1 <*> eval e2`.

## Applicative instances
```Haskell
instance Applicative [] where
    pure :: a -> [a]
    pure x = [x]
    (<*>) :: [a -> b] = [a] -> [b]
```
`(<*>) :: [a -> b] = [a] -> [b]` means : **$[f_1, f_2, ... f_n] <*> [a_1, a_2, ... a_n]$** which essentially outputs a list **[$...,\  f_ia_j, \ ...]$** , which contains all possible computations of $f_i$ on $a_j$.

In a more formal sense:  
`fs <*> xs = [fx | f <- fs, x <- xs]`

> **Question -** Get all combination pairs of weird advertisive adjectives with technical terms of the modern age.   
> **Answer :**
> ```Haskell
> Join xs ys = unwords [xs,ys]
> Adjective = ["cutting edge", "innovative", "disruptive", ...]
> Noun      = ["Product", "Technology", ...]
> all = Join <$> Adjective <*> Noun
> ```

> [!CAUTION]
> In Haskell, you can't directly apply a function `f` to a value `a` if either of them is wrapped in a `Maybe` context. This is because Haskell is a strongly typed language, and it enforces you to handle the possibility of failure (represented by `Nothing`).
