## Class #8 - Types

Some data types:
```Haskell
data Maybe a  = Just a
              | Nothing

data Either a b = Left a
                | Right a

hd : [a] -> Maybe a
```

### Type Classes:
- A principled approach to **ad-hoc polymorphism**.
- If $foo\ xs = Just\ y$, then for some $y \in xs$.

> [!NOTE]
**Overloading** - Same name for different things. Difference in type of function.  
**Polymorphism** - Same definition but uniformly works for all data types.

- eq::a -> a -> Bool
- class Eq a where
  - (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  
instance Eq Bool where

== True True = True
== False False = True
== _ _ = False

foo x y = if x == y then "equal" else "not equal"

instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (a,b) where
    (==) (a1, b1) (a2,b2) = a1 == a2
                            && b1 == b2

instance Eq a => Eq [a] where
(==) x:xs y:ys = (x==y) && (xs==ys)
(==) []    []  = True
(==) _     _   = False
- works foor any time
