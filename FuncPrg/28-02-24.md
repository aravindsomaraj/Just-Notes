## Recap
```Haskell
class Eq a => Ord a where
    (<=) :: a -> a -> Bool
```
- Ord represents a **total order**.

# Class : Deriving and Instances
```Haskell
data Day = Sunday | Monday | ... | Saturday

enum :: Day -> Int    // Equality classing for above type (lexicographic)

data Foo = ...
        |  ...
        |  ...
            deriving (Eq, Ord, Enum)

class Bar = Bar String
          | Biz Int
            deriving Eq

instance Eq Bar where
    (==) (Bar x) (Bar y) = (x == y)
    (==) (Biz x) (Biz y) = (x == y)
    (==)    _       _    =  False
```
> [!NOTE]
> `(<=) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool`
> Ordering (<=) requires the elements to have some form of ordering.  
> `(==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool`
> Equality (==) requires the elements to have some of comparability.

> [!WARNING]
**Function equality does not exist** for class instances.
```Haskell
data Foo a b = Foo (a -> b)
            |  deriving Eq
