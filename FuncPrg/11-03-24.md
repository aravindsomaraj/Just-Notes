# Class Notes

```Haskell
class Functor t => Applicative t where
    pure  :: a -> t a
    (<*>) :: t (a -> b) -> t a -> t b
```
- $f<\$> [x_1\ ...\ x_n] <*> [y_1\ ...\ y_n] = [f x_i y_j\ ...]$

> [!TIP]
> Remember : $[f_1\ ...\ f_m] <*> [y_1\ ...\ y_n] = [...\ kf_iy_j\ ...]$

- Similarly you can build for a function,say, ***g : a -> b -> c -> d***  

> **Cauchy sequence:**
> $\forall \epsilon\ \exists n; \forall m_1,m_2 > n$ 
> $$|x_{m_1} - x_{m_2}| < \epsilon$$ 
> Addition of two cauchy sequences results in a cauchy sequence. This is the notion on which addition of real numbers work.

```Haskell
newtype ZipList a = ZipList [a]
instance Functor ZipList where
    -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> ZipList a -> ZipList b
    fmap f (ZipList lst) = ZipList (fmap f lst) -- Works on empty list as well
```

On a similar note, 
```Haskell
instance Applicative ZipList where
    pure  :: a -> ZipList a
    (<*>) :: ZipList (a -> b) -> ZipList a -> ZipList b
    (<*>) (ZipList fs) (ZipList xs) = ZipList (zipWith ($) fs xs)   -- Note fs :: [a -> b]
