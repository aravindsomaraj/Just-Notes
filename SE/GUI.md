# Graphical User Interface (GUI) [â†©](../Contents/SE.md)

There are various UI frameworks such as MFC (Microsoft Presentation Class), `WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)`, WinUI 3, etc.

WPF is a UI framework that is used for creating desktop client applications.  
XAML is a declarative language that's based on XML, used extensively to build UX.

### Pros : 
- Business logic is separated from UI. (Model <-> View)
- ViewModel and Model can be unit tested independant of the View, as the latter can be also be remodelled.
- Design and development can go in parallel, and mostly independant of each other.   Design-View **|||** Devs-viewModel+Model.

### Cons :
- Overkill for smaller apps.
- Complex data bindings are hard to debug.

## Core principles
- Keep UI responsive. 
- Access UI elements only on the UI thread.
