## Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)
- Goal : high-speed IP forwarding among network of MPLS-capable routers, used fixed length label (instead of shortest prefix matching)
- Router should be able to identify MPLS (aka label-switched router).  

**MPLS vs IP**:
- IP routing: path to destination determined by destination address alone.
- IP/MPLS entry router can use different MPLS routers to A based on IP source address or other fields.
- MPLS routing: path to destination determined on destination address as well as source.
    - flavor of generalized forwarding (MPLS 10 years earlier)
    - Fast rerouting

In regard to MPLS forwarding tables, for routers there are no tables in the data link layer. Only one layer.

## Firewall
- Isolates org's internal network from larger internet, allowing some packets to pass, blocking others.

**Q. Why?**  
It prevents denial of service attacks - SYN flooding where attacker establishes many bogus TCP connections, no resources left for "real" connections.  
It prevents illegal modification/access of internal data.    

> Cisco sells a box that's a firewall. It's both a firewall as well as a router. IP tables?

**Stateless packet-filtering** : Network connected via router's firewall.
