## Switches vs Routers
Both are **store-and-forward**.
- `Routers`  : network-layer devices (examines network-layer headers).
- `Switches` : link-layer devices (examine link-layer headers).  

Both have **forwarding tables**.
- `Routers`  : Compute tables using routing algorithms, IP addresses.
- `Switches` : learn forwarding table using flooding, learning, MAC addresses.

> **Flooding** is a non-adaptive routing technique following this simple method: when a data packet arrives at a router, it is sent to all the outgoing links except the one it has arrived on.

> **ARP Poisoning** is a type of attack, where if Host A wants to send message to Host B, it passes through Host C and the router.

## Virtual LANs (VLANs)

Q: What happens as LAN sizes scale, users change point of attachment?

Virtual LANs enable networking between different points of network without the use of router, and instead uses a switch.

**Single Broadcast domain**
- Scaling : all layer-2 broadcast traffic (ARP,DHCP,unknown MAC), must cross entire LAN.
- Efficiency, security, privacy, efficiency issues.    

**Administrative Issues**
- User moves across physically, but wants to remain logically attached to initial network.

### Port-based VLAN 
Switch ports grouped so that single physical switch operates as multiple virtual switches. **Operates in the physical layer, not the transport layer.** It has 16 ports.
- `Traffic Isolation` : Frames to/from ports 1-8 can only reach ports 1-8. 
- Ports can be dynamically assigned among VLANs.
- `Forwarding between VLANS` is done via **routing** (just as with separate switches).

**VLANS spanning multiple switches**  
`Trunk port` carries frames between VLANS defined over multiple physical switches.
- Frames forwarded within VLANs b/w switches must carry VLAN ID info.
- 802.1q protcol adds/removes additional header fields for frames forwarded between trunk ports.

### EVPN - Ethernet VPNs (aka VXLANs)
IP networking between say Sunnyvale data center and Banglore data center, to send ethernet packet. 2 interfaces which connected to individual switch port.
> Layer-2 Ethernet switches logically connected to each other (using IP as an *underlay*)

Install tor broswer. Uses VPN to enter darknet. Onions? Curiosity killed the cat. But sir says be curious. Lol

In an `onion` network, messages are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to the layers of an onion. The encrypted data is transmitted through a series of network nodes called "onion routers," each of which "peels" away a single layer, revealing the data's next destination.
